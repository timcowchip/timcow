Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.  The complexity scale is exponential,
  with complexity 1 being the lowest complexity.  Complexity is a function
  of both task 'complexity' and task 'scope'.

  The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
  for a person very familiar with BlueZ codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
  require more time and have higher uncertainty.

  Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
  once the task is better understood.

General
==========

- OBEX Actions are used to perform actions not primarily defined as OBEX
  commands. This actions include, for example, moving, copying and setting the
  permissions of objects. OBEX actions would be very useful when implementing
  virtual filesystems over OBEX.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

- Single Response Mode (SRM): The Single Response Mode header shall be used to
  enable this mode, while the SRMP header may be used to alter the normal
  processing of SRM for a single request/response exchange during the current
  operation. The use of the SRMP header is optional; however, GOEP devices that
  support SRM shall be able to receive and process this header. SRMP headers
  should be used judiciously as this will impact the overall throughput of the
  operation using SRM. Receipt of invalid or unexpected Single Response Mode or
  SRMP header values shall be ignored by the receiving device.

  When SRM is active the action of suspending a request can be notified using SRMP
  “wait” option (0x01).

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4
